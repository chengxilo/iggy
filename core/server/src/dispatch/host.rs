//! The server as a [`ShardHost`]: what production and the simulator's shell
//! mode build a shard on.
//!
//! One [`ServerHost`] per shard owns everything the request plane shares
//! across its transports: the per-client FIFO queues and their drain slots,
//! the [`SessionManager`], and the bus connection-lost hook that logs a
//! dropped connection out. All connections installed on the shard dispatch
//! through the same instance, which preserves ordering and disconnect
//! cleanup across transports: the destination shard installs it on delegated
//! TCP/WS/TCP-TLS/WSS connections, and shard 0 also on its local QUIC
//! connections.
//!
//! The host also owns a clone of the bus, so every adapter the bus installs,
//! on client and replica connections alike, keeps the bus alive: accepted,
//! since the bus lives for the process, rather than paid for with a weak
//! upgrade per replica frame.
