//! Deleting data that is still counted must leave the parent totals correct.
//!
//! `stream_size_validation_scenario` covers delete too, but it purges each
//! topic first, so every delete it performs removes an already-empty scope and
//! cannot observe a rollback that never happened. These scenarios delete scopes
//! that still hold messages, which is what the parent totals are wrong about.
//!
//! What this guards, and what it does not. Two mechanisms roll a deleted scope
//! out of its parents: the metadata STM evicts the registry entries at commit
//! and zeroes them into their parents, and the reconciler's partition teardown
//! settles whatever landed after that. The STM half runs inside the apply that
//! produces the ack, on counters shared across every shard and both left-right
//! buffers, so it alone satisfies every assertion here. The reconciler runs as
//! a separate task, but a delete commit wakes it (`signal_reconcile_wake`), so
//! it too finishes before a client can complete another round trip.
//!
//! Measured, not reasoned: with only the STM rollback disabled this scenario
//! PASSES (while the `metadata::stm::stream` unit tests fail), and with only
//! the reconciler settle disabled it also passes. It fails only when BOTH are
//! disabled. Either mechanism alone keeps a client's view correct, so this is a
//! contract test for what a client observes and not a regression guard for
//! either half.
//!
//! Each half is guarded by unit tests instead: the `metadata::stm::stream`
//! module for the rollback and eviction, `server::partition_reconciler` for the
//! teardown settle and the membership gate. The integration layer cannot hold
//! the reconciler off by configuration -- the tick is capped at 30s, cannot be
//! set to zero, and the commit wake bypasses it regardless.
//!
//! Verifying any of this needs `cargo build --bin iggy-server` first. The
//! harness spawns the built binary, so a source-only mutation runs against the
//! previous build and reports a green that means nothing.
//!
//! The reads after each delete are deliberately single-shot. Retrying until the
//! numbers converge, the way the pre-delete assertions do for the async send
//! folding, would also wait out a broken rollback and pass regardless.
