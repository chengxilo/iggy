//! On-disk format backwards compatibility.
//!
//! A server built from the master tip the change merges onto (the BASELINE)
//! writes a rich data directory. The same directory is then restarted under
//! the build under test, and everything must read back unchanged:
//!
//! - A checkpointed metadata snapshot holding topics with every option key,
//!   partitions with a deletion watermark and a purge generation, consumer
//!   groups, users with permissions and personal access tokens, all created
//!   BEFORE the checkpoint fires, plus an uncheckpointed WAL tail holding one
//!   more of each, created after it. The snapshot and the WAL encode the same
//!   types differently, and either can break on its own.
//! - Sealed and active segments in a non-zero partition, holding messages
//!   with explicit ids, typed user headers and payload lengths that vary
//!   inside every batch, and a partial segment deletion.
//! - Individual and group consumer offsets, and a purge generation with
//!   messages appended past it.
//!
//! The swap works because `ServerHandle::start` re-reads
//! `config.executable_path` on every call while the data directory, the
//! ports and the harness paths all survive a `stop`.
//!
//! # Why every assertion here is about DATA
//!
//! Three failure modes reach exit code 0 with a server that boots and serves:
//!
//! - A partition whose durable state cannot be read is TOMBSTONED and boot
//!   continues. Only the log says so.
//! - A topic loses a single storage option, per key, with no log line at
//!   all: `TopicCreateOptions::parse_committed` deliberately discards
//!   per-entry parse errors so one unreadable key cannot drop the rest.
//! - A segment misparse can truncate a torn tail while the messages a test
//!   happens to poll still read back fine, because segment batch headers
//!   carry no magic and no version.
//!
//! So the test asserts the tombstone marker is absent, re-reads every seeded
//! option value AND its provenance flag, compares every stored message field
//! against a read taken from the baseline, and byte-compares the segment
//! files across the swap. It stops producing MID-segment on purpose: boot
//! unseals the last segment, so a chain that ends on a rotation boundary
//! would only ever hand that path an empty file.
//!
//! # The configuration is held constant across the swap
//!
//! Both boots read the BASELINE's `core/server/config.toml`, extracted next
//! to the baseline binary by `scripts/ci/storage-compat.sh`. Neither side may
//! fall back to the server's relative default path: figment resolves that by
//! walking up from the test process's directory, so the BASELINE parses THIS
//! branch's file, and a key added under a `deny_unknown_fields` table (every
//! `[cluster]` and `[node]` one) fails its extraction with
//! `Config(CannotLoadConfiguration)`. That reads as a compatibility break and
//! is not one.
//!
//! One file across the swap leaves the binary as the only variable, and it
//! pins the two rules the config plane already carries: a field this branch
//! adds needs its `#[serde(default)]`, because the build under test boots on
//! a file written before the field existed, and a key this branch takes away
//! needs its `RelocatedKey` entry. Deleting a key from a
//! `deny_unknown_fields` table, or relocating one, makes the SECOND boot
//! refuse the file; strip that key from the extracted copy when it happens.
//!
//! The overrides below reach both binaries as `IGGY_*` variables, and
//! `resolve_config_paths` checks them against the catalog of the build under
//! test only. [`assert_overrides_known_to_the_baseline`] covers the other
//! side, where an unknown `IGGY_*` name trips a `debug_assert` and takes the
//! debug binary down at boot.
//!
//! `IGGY_TEST_VERBOSE` makes the harness inherit the server's stdout instead
//! of capturing it, which would make the tombstone check vacuous. The
//! graceful-shutdown assertion below is taken on the same log and fails
//! loudly in that case rather than passing on an empty file.
