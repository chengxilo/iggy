//! Adversarial specs against the VSR client table's at-most-once guarantees.
//!
//! Each asserts the dedup contract a retrying client needs: the first two at
//! the table's resource edges, the third across the request-id gaps a client
//! that also produces leaves behind.
//!
//! 1. Capacity: a full table evicts the entry with the oldest commit. Eviction
//!    keeps that client's request watermark (and the watermark's reply when the
//!    ring still held it), so a client that was merely quiet re-registers and
//!    its retry of an already-committed request id is answered, not re-executed.
//! 2. Reply retention: an entry keeps `REPLY_RING_CAPACITY` replies whatever
//!    they weigh and older ones for as long as they fit
//!    `REPLY_RING_RETENTION_BYTES`, so a retry arriving more commits late than
//!    the floor alone would hold still replays its original bytes. The depth is
//!    bounded, not unlimited: a retry that outlives the byte budget is still
//!    answered with the terminal `RequestAlreadyApplied` and no result payload,
//!    which the caller cannot tell apart from a rejection. That edge, and the
//!    fact that neither a state transfer nor a restart carries the deeper
//!    history, are pinned by the consensus crate's unit tests; this file pins
//!    the depth the budget buys on a live server.
//! 3. Sequence gaps: partition sends spend request ids on a plane that keeps no
//!    client table, so the next metadata request arrives with a gap under it.
//!    The entry stores a watermark, not a contiguous sequence, so the gapped
//!    request must execute once and its retry must replay that reply.
//!
//! The frames are hand-crafted on raw TCP sockets, same technique and frame
//! builders as the clients-table restart tests, because the churn needs
//! per-connection client identities and byte-level replay the SDK does not
//! expose. The builders here are parameterized by client id, which is why the
//! restart tests' fixed-identity helpers are not reused directly.
