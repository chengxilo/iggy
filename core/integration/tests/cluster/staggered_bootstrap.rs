//! A cluster whose replica 0 arrives after the others have already elected.
//!
//! Nothing in the server's bootstrap waits for peers: `await_bootstrap_complete`
//! is intra-node (shard 0 waiting on its sibling shards), and each node binds
//! its listeners as soon as its own shards load. So a slow replica 0 does not
//! hold the cluster back. Replicas 1 and 2 miss its heartbeats, conclude an
//! election, and start serving at a view whose primary is not replica 0.
//!
//! Every other cluster test starts through `TestHarness::start`, which waits
//! for all nodes to mesh before the first client op, so none of them can reach
//! this state. `partition_primary_routing` reaches the same view split by
//! killing node 0 mid-test; this reaches it the way production does, and the
//! two entry points exercise different code (a group materialised on a node
//! that was never in the founding quorum, versus one materialised on a node
//! that was).
//!
//! Two independent things are asserted, because they can fail separately:
//!
//! - A topic created while replica 0 is absent is writable at the advertised
//!   leader. This is the routing contract, and it holds only because a fresh
//!   partition group seeds its view from the metadata plane rather than
//!   starting at view 0 (which would name replica 0, the node that was late).
//! - The late replica converges. It missed the ops committed before it
//!   arrived, and the harness's usual all-nodes mesh gate is what normally
//!   guarantees no node is ever in that position.
