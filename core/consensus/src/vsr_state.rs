//! The durable VSR state: the consensus numbers a replica must recover from its
//! own disk after a crash, rather than infer from the WAL or relearn from a
//! peer.
//!
//! The payload `journal::superblock` persists. Consensus owns its meaning and
//! byte layout; the superblock adds framing, versioning, and integrity.
//!
//! Fixed little-endian, so it is byte-identical across replicas and stable
//! across restarts. Field order is load-bearing: reorders and width changes are
//! breaking and must ride a superblock version bump.
