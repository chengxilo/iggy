# storage-compat.sh -- Prove HEAD still reads a data directory written by master.
#
# Builds two iggy-server binaries and hands both to one integration test:
#   baseline  built from --baseline-ref, copied aside. Default: on a
#             pull_request run, the master tip under the checked-out merge ref;
#             anywhere else, origin/master.
#   HEAD      built from the working tree, left at target/debug/iggy-server
# The test boots the baseline, seeds a data directory, swaps the binary to HEAD
# and restarts against that same directory.
#
# The baseline's own core/server/config.toml is extracted next to its binary and
# both boots read it, so the swap changes the binary and nothing else.
#
# Both binaries MUST be built here. `core/integration` has no dependency on the
# `server` package; the harness only LOCATES a binary, through
# `assert_cmd::Command::cargo_bin`, which falls back to whatever file happens to
# sit at target/debug/iggy-server (assert_cmd 2.2.2 `legacy_cargo_bin`). So
# `cargo nextest run -p integration` compiles no server at all, and a lane that
# does not build both halves compares a stale binary against itself and reports
# green forever.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = compatible, non-zero = build failure or format regression.

# Empty selects the default described above once HEAD is known.
