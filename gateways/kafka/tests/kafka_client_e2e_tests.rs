//! End-to-end tests driving **real Kafka clients** against the gateway.
//!
//! Every other suite in this crate hand-builds wire frames, which cannot catch a client
//! compatibility problem by construction. One already slipped through that way: advertising
//! `SaslHandshake` from v1 rather than v0 passed every hand-built test and made librdkafka report
//! "SASL Handshake not supported by broker" before it sent anything. These tests exist so that
//! class of bug fails in CI instead of during manual testing.
//!
//! The stack is real on all three sides: a spawned `iggy-server` process, the gateway in-process
//! with a real `IggyAuthenticator`, and a client from a container. They automate categories S and T
//! of `docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md`.
//!
//! Prerequisites are Docker and an already-built `iggy-server`. Missing either skips, the way the
//! wire-fixture suites do, unless `KAFKA_E2E_REQUIRED=1` is set, which turns a skip into a failure
//! so a broken CI step cannot leave these silently green.
